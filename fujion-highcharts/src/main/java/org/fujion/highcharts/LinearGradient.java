/**
 * A linear gradient that lets us create gradients in plot bands instead of just using solid colors.
 * I only put the properties I needed into this class. The highcharts' javascript class has more
 * properties than this so feel free to add them if you need to. According to:
 * http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#LinearGradients linear gradients are defined as a line in
 * a coordinate system that has its origin in the top left (0, 0) and with (1, 1) being in the
 * bottom right. In other words, it starts in the top left and as you go to the right, x increases
 * and as you go down, y increases.
